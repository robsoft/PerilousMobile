roughly 1 days work to complete this to playable (no gui)
 * version numbering - 15m
 * combat - plan out first, 45m
 * android sanity check - 30m
 * food - 45m
 * weapons - 30m
 * code combat - 90m
 * puzzle ends in finding a map - 15m
 * princess rescue page - 15m
 * leave swamp page - 15m
 * inventory list - 60m
 * inventory also shows approximately how much food, puzzles, loot etc left to find - 60m
 * 'deus ex machina' providing advice & stats?
 * health goes down slightly quicker when with princess, also food gets halved 


# to-do
* figure out balances between combat, health, armour
* actually write combat code
* better logic in the 'flee/run' randomiser
* figure out puzzle games and add them in
* testing for death/game over/no health etc
* consider provision for puzzles
* save state / resume
* consider GUI
* graphics tiles etc
