# to-do
* Basic Game class
* Randomly populate Map / generate game world
     - a dozen 'baddie' types
     - provision for puzzle types
     - some treasure/loot locations
     - some 'empty' locations
     - possibility of 'fog'
     - player & princess locations
     - run takes you to a random adjacent place
* crude map 'display' for now
* handle encounters (fight, points etc)
* death
* consider provision for puzzles
* save state / resume
* consider GUI
* graphics tiles etc


also;
ring, zap, bat etc
potions, rings, swords, axes etc from puzzles
potion restores combat points 25% of max at a time
sword increases combat points effectiveness

grateful, bemused, charming, spoilt, angry, sad, upset, hearty, voluptuous princess
scaley, slimey, vicious, angry, violent, furious, confused, wicked, cunning, devious, 
balrog, wraith, troll, ringwraith, goblin, giant lizard, ape, serpent, vulture, giant spider,

fog is random shaped cloud that moves across the map every other turn
not quite enough points to decimate a vulture, get carried away 2-3 squares

all monster hp, names etc decided at game init
if you fight a monster and then run, it will heal over next few turns
rethink how much of map you can see at once?

want 20 diff monster types
8 different puzzle games (think nightmare park?)


need to have 2 concepts;
overall combat points and then adjusters for armour & weaponry


turn map into series of objects? not array of ints?
